# **Papramaki: The Best Spending Tracker in the Galaxy**

Papramaki is an Android application that tracks users' spending habits. Users can set a budget for a period between one and twelve weeks, enter their expenditures, and receive analysis of the way they are spending their money as the budget period progresses.

## Installation

To run this program, you will need a device or a simulator that runs on the Android operating system. Connect your Android device or open your simulator on a computer to which the project has been saved. Open the program and run it. Doing this for the first time will install the application on your device or simulator.

## Running and Using Papramaki

Running the program will automatically open the application. Upon opening the application for the first time, you will be taken to a login screen. From there, you can tap the button labeled "Sign Up" to open a sign up screen. You can sign up for an account by entering your email address and selecting a password (minimum 8 characters). From there, you will be taken to the analysis fragment, which will not yet have any data to show. Swipe left to reach the budget fragment, where you can create a new budget by entering an amount and selecting a duration (between 1 and 12 weeks). Tap the "Save" button to create a new budget in your account. If you swipe right, back to the analysis fragment, you will see that the text has changed to reflect your new budget.

From any fragment in the application, you will be able to input a new expenditure by tapping the circular floating action button in the lower right hand corner of the screen. Doing so will bring up a new screen labeled "New Expenditure." You can exit this screen if you tapped the floating action button by mistake by tapping the arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen. If you would like to record a new expenditure, you can do so by entering a number in the "Amount" field (currency symbols are unnecessary). You also have the option of categorizing your expenditure by typing one in the "New category" text field. On your first time using the app, the dropdown menu below the amount text field will be empty, but it will store any expenditure categories you create so that you can easily access them for future expenditures. If you do not enter a category, your expenditure will be marked "Uncategorized."

Tapping the "Save" button will add your new expenditure to your history and take you back to the analysis fragment. You will now see a pie chart (all one color, because you only have one category of expenditure so far), with text in the center telling you how much of your current budget you have spent. The pie chart reflects the amount of money you have spent, so that, as you record more expenditures, you will be able to see at a glance in which areas you are spending the most money. If you tap on a section of the pie chart, a notification will pop up to tell you which category it represents and exactly how much money you have spent in that category for your current budget. At the bottom of the screen, there is also text telling you how much money you have left in your current budget. If you have spent more money than is in your current budget, this text will turn from black to red, so that you have an immediate visual reminder that you are over budget.

If you swipe right, you will be taken to the history fragment. Here you can see a list of your expenditures (amount, category, and date recorded), with the most recent at the top of the list.

Swiping left twice will take you back to the budget fragment. If your budget is not expired, you can edit it. You can set a new expiration date by tapping the "Edit Expiration Date" button and selecting a new date from the date picker that will open. You can also update the amount of money in your budget by entering a number in the text field. To save any changes to your budget, tap the "Update" button.

To log out, tap the three vertical dots in the upper right hand corner of the screen and tap "Log out." This will take you back to the login screen you saw when you first launched the application. From here, you can log back in by entering the email and password you selected during your sign up and tapping the "Log in" button.

When you log back in to the app, you will be taken to the analysis fragment if your budget is not expired. If the expiration date for your current budget has passed, then you will be taken to the budget fragment and you will be prompted to create a new budget. After entering a new budget, you will be able to continue using all of the functions of the application as before.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How will I remember when my budget expires?**

A: You can look at (and edit) the expiration date of your current budget at any time by swiping over to the budget fragment. If the expiration date for your budget has passed, then you will be immediately taken to this fragment and prompted to create a new budget upon opening the application.

**Q: Can I edit an existing budget?**

A: Yes. If your budget has not expired, then you can update your budget at any time in the budget fragment. To update the amount, enter a new number in the text field. To update the expiration date, tap the "Edit Expiration Date" button and select a new date from the date picker that pops up.

**Q: What if I accidentally tap the floating action button when I don't have a new expenditure to record?**

A: Simply tap the arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen to return to the budget fragment without changing your spending history.

**Q: What does the pie chart represent?**

A: The pie chart represents the money you have spent so far (in your current budget), broken down by category. For example, if you have spent $20 on groceries, $10 on coffee, and $100 on textbooks, then your pie chart will represent the breakdown of how you spent that $130. There will be three pie chart sections, each a different color. You can tap on a single section of the pie chart to see which category it represents and exactly how much money you have spent in that category during your current budget period.

**Q: What is the spending history?**

A: Your spending history is a list of all the expenditures (amount, category, and date recorded) you have recorded while your current budget was in effect. You can see this information at any time by swiping right to the history fragment.
